# Contributing

All contributions are made with the pull-request system. In order to contribute, please follow the following steps:

- Create an issue with the correct label (i.e. Documentation/Bug/Feature)
- Create a new branch starting with the issue type : `feat/...`, `fix/...` or `doc/...`. GitHub Action (CI) will be
  triggered on each push on your branch. Warning, after the first push on your branch, an automatic commit/push will be
  made by the CI in order to increment the version. Thus, remember to update your repository after your first commit.
- Implement your change
- Open a Pull Request (don't forget to link the PR to the issue)
- PR will be reviewed by the Professional Service Team and merged if all the checks are successful

# Code conventions

We're using different tools to ensure good code quality and consistency.

- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): linter for Python. We're using a 120 character max line length (
  configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/): optimize import orders  (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for code quality checks. Our CI will reject any errors
  or code with an overall score under 8.  (configured in `pyproject.toml`).

If you want to automaticly run the linters and the code quality checks, you can use the following command to add this
ckecks as a pre-commit hook:

```
poetry run pre-commit install
```

# Commits Guidelines

We're using the [Python Semantic Release library](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage
our versioning.

In order to work properly, you need to follow
the  [Emoji Parser commit style](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#major-emoji)
when squashing the commits during the merge of the PR to master.

- Commit messages starting with the following emoji will generate a new patch version :
    - :ambulance: : hot fix
    - :lock: :  security fix
    - :bug: : bug fix
    - :zap: : performance improvment
    - :penguin: : updating dependency
    - :robot: : CI update 
    - :wheelchair: : refactoring 
- Commit messages starting with the :sparkles: emoji (new feature) will generate a new minor version 
- Commit messages starting with the :boom: emoji will (breaking change) generate a new major version
