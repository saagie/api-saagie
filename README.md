## Presentation

The `saagieapi` python package implements python API wrappers to easily interact with the Saagie platform in python.

There are two subpackages that each give access to a main class whose methods allows to interact with the API :

* The `manager` subpackage implements the `SaagieApiManager` class whose methods can interact with the `manager`
  interface in Saagie (Saagie legacy)
* The `projects` subpackage implements the `SaagieApi` class whose methods can interact with the `Projects` interface in
  Saagie (current main interface)

## Installing

```bash
pip install saagieapi==<version>
```

## Usage

### Projects

```python
from saagieapi.projects import SaagieApi

saagie = SaagieApi(url_saagie="<url>",
                   id_platform="1",
                   user="<saagie-user-name>",
                   password="<saagie-user-password>",
                   realm="saagie")

# Create a project named 'Project_test' on the saagie platform
project_dict = saagie.create_project(name="Project_test",
                                     group="<saagie-group-with-proper-permissions>",
                                     role='Manager',
                                     description='A test project')

# Save the project id
project_id = project_dict['createProject']['id']

# Create a python job named 'Python test job' inside this project
job_dict = saagie.create_job(job_name="Python test job",
                             project_id=project_id,
                             file='<path-to-local-file>',
                             description='Amazing python job',
                             category='Processing',
                             technology_catalog='Saagie',
                             technology='python',
                             runtime_version='3.6',
                             command_line='python {file} arg1 arg2',
                             release_note='',
                             extra_technology=''
                             )

# Save the job id
job_id = job_dict['data']['createJob']['id']

# Run the python job and wait for its completion
saagie.run_job_callback(job_id=job_id, freq=10, timeout=-1)

```

### Connecting to your platform

There are 2 options to connect to your platform :  

1. using the default constructor : 
```python
saagie = SaagieApi(url_saagie="<url>",
                   id_platform="1",
                   user="<saagie-user-name>",
                   password="<saagie-user-password>",
                   realm="saagie")
 ```


2. Using the `easy_connect` alternative constructor which uses the complete URL (eg: 
        https://mysaagie-workspace.prod.saagie.com/projects/platform/6/) and will 
        parse it in order to retrieve the platform URL, platform id and the 
        realm.
```python
saagie = SaagieApi.easy_connect(url_saagie_platform="<url>",
                   user="<saagie-user-name>",
                   password="<saagie-user-password>")
```

#### Finding your platform, project, job and instances ids

Your Saagie projects homepage has the following structure `https://<REALM>-workspace.me.saagie.com/projects/platform/<PLATFORM_ID>/`

> `https://mysaagie-workspace.me.saagie.com/projects/platform/1/`
>would give  : 
> - `platform_id` = 1
> - `realm` = mysaagie 

**Project id** can be found in the project URL after the `/project` 

> `https://mysaagie-workspace.me.saagie.com/projects/platform/1/project/8321e13c-892a-4481-8552-5be4b6cc5df4/jobs`
> would give  : 
> - `project_id` = 8321e13c-892a-4481-8552-5be4b6cc5df4


**Job id** can be found in the project URL after the `/job` 

> `https://mysaagie-workspace.me.saagie.com/projects/platform/1/project/8321e13c-892a-4481-8552-5be4b6cc5df4/job/a85ac3db-bca1-4f15-b8f7-44731fba874b`
> would give  : 
> - `job_id` = a85ac3db-bca1-4f15-b8f7-44731fba874b

**App id** can be found in the project URL after the `/app` 

> `https://mysaagie-workspace.me.saagie.com/projects/platform/1/project/8321e13c-892a-4481-8552-5be4b6cc5df4/app/02c01d47-8a29-47d0-a53c-235add43c885`
> would give  : 
> - `app_id` = 02c01d47-8a29-47d0-a53c-235add43c885

**Pipeline id** can be found in the project URL after the `/pipeline` 

> `https://mysaagie-workspace.me.saagie.com/projects/platform/1/project/8321e13c-892a-4481-8552-5be4b6cc5df4/pipeline/4da29f25-e7c9-4410-869e-40b9ba0074d1`
> would give  : 
> - `pipeline_id` = 4da29f25-e7c9-4410-869e-40b9ba0074d1

**Job instance id** can be found in the project URL after the `/instances` 

> `https://mysaagie-workspace.me.saagie.com/projects/platform/1/project/8321e13c-892a-4481-8552-5be4b6cc5df4/job/a85ac3db-bca1-4f15-b8f7-44731fba874b/instances/6ff448ae-3770-4639-b0f8-079e5c614ab6`
